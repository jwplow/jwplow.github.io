	<h1>Build Your Own Website: Part 1</h1>

		<h2>1. Define Your Audience/Tone</h2>
			
			<h3>Who will visit your site? Potential employers? New clients or customers?</h3>
			<p>Three types of people: 1st) Explorers: Individuals exploring new technology.  2nd) Dreamers: People who are interested in the service, but can't afford or don't have an event planned.  3rd) Customers: An individual who is interested in the service and is requesting a private charter to an event or special occasion.</p>

			<h3>What can make you and/or your product stand out against your competitors?</h3>
			<p>Current air charter brokers do not have a method to charge per seat, nor do they have a plan or method to group a passenger and their network on an private airplane.  This website will provide the opportunity for individuals to fly with their network and reduce the cost of private charter aviation making it a viable alternative to flying first or business class on commercial airlines.</p>

			<h3>How would you speak to your clientele if you were communicating in person?  How could you translate that style and tone digitally?</h3>
			<p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>The problem:</b> Chartering an airplane is an awesome experience, but it is extremely expensive.  Not an option for most of the population.  Charter flights are expensive because they typically fly over half empty.  There is currently no solution to group people on a charter flight.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> This company will make chartering an airplane, less expensive easy to book, eliminates fractional ownership, and won't require annual fees or membership.  We do this by optimizing the capacity utilization by increasing the number of occupied seats. In other words, we will fill the private plane with people going on a round trip to the same place on the same date.  </li>
			<li><b>The Process:</b> Choose from 22,000 events, select one an aircraft, share the details with your network, pay for your seat, and travel to your event an experience a private terminal and airplane. </li>
			<li><b>The Website</b>The process of booking a flight will be the easiest in the air charter industry.  We will also have the most information about airplanes, operators, events, location information, and executive terminals.  In addition, we will have a cool features that will allow someone to watch the flight in real-time through a virtual cockpit following the flight along the journey which will include speed and estimated arrival time, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>What colors represent your or your product?</h3>
			<p>Our company will have the most stringent method for  hiring air charter operators with the best safety record. Therefore we will use the following colors: 
			<ul>
			<li><b>Blue:</b> Perceived as trustworthy, dependable, fiscally responsible and secure. Strongly associated with the sky and sea, blue is serene and universally well-liked. Blue is an especially popular color with financial institutions, as its message of stability inspires trust.</li>
			<li><b>White:</b> Connotes simplicity, cleanliness and purity. The human eye views white as a brilliant color, so it immediately catches the eye in signage.</li>
			<li><b>Grey:</b> Implies security and reliability. </li>
			<li><b>Black:</b> Is serious, bold, powerful and classic. It creates drama and connotes sophistication. Black works well for expensive products.</li>
